Todo:
- Round Robin for DCN addresses
- Intelligent distribution of the DepthCache start sequence to the DCNs for faster availability and better selection of a suitable DCN.
- Sync DNC last restart time
- restapi: Add error if result is OK but one or mor DCNs did not response


Ideas:
- use websocket between client und restapi instead of rest
- Replace JSON lib?
